Here is the code that applies the CSS styles to the HTML elements.

This code includes an inline style for the <h2> element where CSS is written directly inside an HTML element using the style attribute so it is easy for small changes but not recommended for larger styles.

This code includes an internal CSS for the <h3> element where CSS is written inside a <style> tag in the <head> section of the HTML document, which is useful for styling multiple elements on the same page.

Finally, this code includes an external CSS for the <h4> element where styles are defined in an external CSS file (style.css) and linked to the HTML document using a <link> tag. This is the best practice for larger projects as it keeps the HTML clean and separates content from presentation.
