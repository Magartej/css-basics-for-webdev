<!-- 
The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in web design and layout. It describes how elements on a web page are structured and how space is calculated around them. It is made up of four main components: content, padding, border, and margin.
In content area, the actual text or image is displayed. 

Padding is the space between the content and the border which adds space inside the element around the content.

The border wraps around the padding and content, and you can set its width, style and color.

Margin is the space outside the border which separates the element from other elements on the page.

This example demonstrates the CSS Box Model by creating two boxes with different styles. Each box has a background color, text color, padding, margin, and border. 

This example uses the `box-sizing: border-box;` property to include padding and border in the element's total width and height, which is a common practice in modern web design. 

Here the concept margincollapses occured as two vertical margins meets, and in margincollapse the larger of the two margins applied and the smaller one will be ignored.
