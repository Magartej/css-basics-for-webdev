<!-- 
Here color can be represented in:
1. Color Keywords  
The color keywords are predefined color names that can be used in CSS. Examples include "red", "blue", "green", etc.

2. HexColor Code
The hexadecimal color code is a six-digit code that represents a color in the RGB color model. It starts with a hash symbol (#) followed by six hexadecimal digits. For example, #FF5733 represents a shade of red.

3. RGB
The RGB color model represents colors using the combination of red, green, and blue light. Each color component can have a value between 0 and 255. For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) represents pure red.

4. RGBA
The RGBA color model is an extension of the RGB model that includes an alpha channel for transparency. The alpha value can range from 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (completely opaque). For example, rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5) represents a semi-transparent red.

5. HSL
The HSL color model represents colors using hue, saturation, and lightness. Hue is represented as an angle (0-360 degrees), saturation is a percentage (0-100%), and lightness is also a percentage (0-100%). For example, hsl(120, 100%, 50%) represents pure green.
